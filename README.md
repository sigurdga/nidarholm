Source code for nidarholm.no
============================

The Nidarholm project was started with very simple apps replacing most of the old php code. There will be developed apps outside this project that are more usable and reusable by others that will replace the simpler internal ones.

Since this is a project, you will find the complete settings.py file here. The project is _not_ ready for prime time, but is usable for developers, at least as an inspiration.

Deployment
----------

Up until now done by pulling from git to the server directory. The apache and wsgi setup is placed in the _config_ directory.

About Nidarholm and the intranet
--------------------------------

Nidarholm is one of the top wind bands of Norway, and the older versions of their intranet was quite modern. Development had stopped and the old php code was nearly untouched for several years.

The project was re-initiated in September 2010, and in three months we had something usable again. Initial version deployed 12th of December 2010.

The intention is to make a really good intranet system for wind bands, and later other organizations.
